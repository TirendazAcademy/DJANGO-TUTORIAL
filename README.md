[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a powerful web framework for building complex and robust web applications with Python. It follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a wide range of built-in features to help developers quickly and efficiently build web apps.

This repository contains sample projects and tutorials that demonstrate how to use Django to build web applications. To get started, you will need to have a basic understanding of Python and some experience with web development.

- Installing Django: To use Django, you will first need to install it on your machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: `pip install Django`.

- Creating a new project: Once you have Django installed, you can create a new project by running the command django-admin startproject projectname. This will create a new directory with the same name as your project and set up the basic file structure for a Django project.

- Creating an app: After you have created a new project, you can create an app within the project by running the command python manage.py startapp appname. This will create a new directory with the same name as your app and set up the basic file structure for a Django app.

- Defining models: Models define the structure of your data and how it is stored in the database. In Django, you define models in the models.py file within your app.

- Creating views: Views handle the logic for handling user requests and returning responses. In Django, you define views in the views.py file within your app.

- Creating templates: Templates define the structure and layout of your HTML pages. In Django, you define templates in the templates directory within your app.

- Mapping URLs: Finally, you need to map URLs to views in the urls.py file within your app.

These are the basic steps to get started with Django, but there are many other features and tools available to help you build more complex and powerful web applications. You can find more information and tutorials in the documents of this repository.
